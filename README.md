<!-- ## IMPORTANT NOTE

<!-- __*LoIDE started as an undergraduate student's work of thesis, and is still at the early stages of development.*__ -->

<!-- __*It currently supports only Answer Set Programming; we encourage any feedback, but we do NOT recommend it for production yet.*__ -->


## Online Demo
Find a live demo at www.mat.unical.it/calimeri/projects/loide

<!-- This online version uses the [EmbASPServerExecutor](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/EmbASPServerExecutor) to run the solvers -->


## Purpose
The main goal of the LoIDE project is the release of a modular and extensible web-IDE for Logic Programming using modern technologies and languages.

A further goal of the project is to provide a web-service with a common set of APIs for different logic-based languages.  
Further information can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/LoIDE/wiki/APIs)

## Key Features

 - Syntax highlighting
 - Output highlighting
 - Layout and appearance customization
 - Keyboard shortcuts
 - Multiple file support
 - Execution and Solvers options definition
 - Import and Export files


## Getting Started (Installation and Usage)
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
It only requires [Node.js&reg;](https://nodejs.org)

### Download
You can find the latest version of LoIDE [here](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/LoIDE/releases/latest).

Otherwise you can clone this repository.

Remember that you can always see all the releases of LoIDE [here](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/LoIDE/releases). 

### Install
Install dependencies:
 ```
 npm install
 ```

Now you can run LoIDE in development or in production mode.

### Run in production mode
In this mode, LoIDE will be optimized for production.

Start the server:
```
npm start
```

Use _LoIDE_ in a browser at:
```
http://localhost:8084
```

If you wish to run _LoIDE_ over HTTPS, you must provide paths to certificate files in the ```app-config.json``` file.
Then, you can start _LoIDE_ in a browser at: 
```
http://localhost:8085
```

### Run in development mode
Run LoIDE in development mode only for development and testing purposes.

Start the server:
```
npm run start:dev
```

The browser will be opened automatically _LoIDE_ in at:
```
http://localhost:7000
```

### Note
You need an "executor" in order to run the solvers.

If you like it, you can use our [EmbASPServerExecutor](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/EmbASPServerExecutor).
